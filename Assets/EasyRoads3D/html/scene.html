  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Rotation:</span> The rotation of the connection</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Rotate Connection:</span> Depending on the connected roads and available free connections, this button will rotate the prefab and swap connections. This is for example useful for T Crossings to rotate or mirror the crossing</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">T-Crossing:</span> This is active on dynamic X, T crossings and will build the prefab according this status</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Sidewalks:</span> This is active on dynamic connection prefabs and will set the global sidewalk status</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Delete Connection:</span> This will remove the connection from the scene</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Select Connection in Hierarchy:</span> This will select the actual rotation game object. For dynamic crossings <a href="general_settings.html#generalCrossingSettings" class="link">the connection properties</a> will be displayed. </li>
</ul>

<p class="header2">I Connector <span class="style21">[Pro]</span><a name="IConnector" id="addmarkers11"></a></p>
<p>The I Connector differs from other Connection prefabs in a way that it not a prefab physically available in the assets folder or in the Connection Prefabs tab, the 3rd tab from the left in the Inspector.</p>
<p>I Connectors can be attached to any marker through the <a href="#IConnector" class="link">Insert I Connector</a> button in the marker section. If this is not the first or last marker of the selected road, the road will be split in two roads at the selected marker with the I Connector in between the two.</p>
<p>I Connectors can be used for:</p>
<p>1) Blending roads, for example asphalt roads and dirt tracks</p>
<p>2) Using different materials on a specific road segment</p>
<p>3) Connecting non matching road types</p>
<p>4) Cut roads in pieces for occlusion culling or streaming road network sections usually terrain tile specific.</p>

<p><strong>I Connector Properties</strong></p>
<p><span class="style21"><img src="../images/IConnector.jpg" width="516"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="header2">Road 1 and Road 2</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Road Type Preset: </span>The road type of the connected road. If no road is connected, new roads pulled out of that connection will be of the selected road type.</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Material:</span> The material assigned to the road. This currently has no function.</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Connector Distance:</span> By default the IConnector will connect both roads. Setting a Connector Distance will make it possible to adapt road widths and / or blend different road types.</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Stretch Width:</span> This will adapt the width over the connection distance. Options are Lineair, exponentional and smooth. &quot;Strech to fit&quot; will auto auto set the stretch level to match width of the other road.</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Sub Division:</span> Stretching can result in zigzag type of texturing. The Sub Division level will be useful here. The higher the value the more the zig zag effect will be reduced.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="header2">Additional Settings</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Resolution:</span> The geometry resolution of the Connection</li>
  <li><span class="propertyStyle">Transition Type:</span> The type of transition, [None], [Blend textures] or [Texture Transition]. Depending on the selection the below options will display<br>
    <br>
    <span class="style21"><img src="../images/IConnectorBlend.jpg" width="515"></span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="propertyStyle">Blend Textures:</span><br>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="propertyStyle">Blend Textures:</span> This will activate the blend options</li>
      <li><span class="propertyStyle">Blend Distance:</span> The distance over which the textures will blend</li>
      <li><span class="propertyStyle">Blend Section:</span> The blending can be done over the main connection (road 1), road 2 or over both sections. In general you want to use the wider road. For example a wider asphalt road with dirt track blending on the asphalt section.</li>
      <li><span class="propertyStyle">Blend Presets:</span> This is not active yet. It is intended to auto assign I Connector settings based on the involved road types.</li>
      <li><span class="propertyStyle">Blend Material:</span> The material used for the blending. Examples are the shaders &quot;ER Dual Road Blend&quot; for two different road types and &quot;ER Single Road Blend&quot; for the same road types. The &quot;Build&quot; button will auto set the material based on the materials on the connected road objects provided that these shaders have standard Unity property names are  (_MainTex, _BumpMap, _Metallic, _Glossiness, _Color, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <span class="style21"><img src="../images/IConnectorTexture.jpg" width="517"></span><br>
<br>
  </li>
  
  <span class="propertyStyle">Texture Transition:</span><br>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="propertyStyle">Transition section:</span> On which of the two roads will the transition take place</li>
    <li><span class="propertyStyle">Transition Material:</span> The material that should be used for the transition. The &quot;Build&quot; button will auto set the material based on the materials on the connected road objects provided that these shaders have standard Unity property names are  (_MainTex, _BumpMap, _Metallic, _Glossiness, _Color, etc.)</li>
    <li><span class="propertyStyle">Swap Direction:</span> Swap the UV coordinates so the transition is reversed</li>
