# StrangeTown
Strange Town is a unity scene with 9 blocks designed for cars to drive around.

You will need to import these [Free City Assets](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/city-package-107224) for the Unity Project.

Pending: light baking and occlusion (to do on Eve computer).
